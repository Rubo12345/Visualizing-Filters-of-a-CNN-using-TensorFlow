# Visualizing-Filters-of-a-CNN-using-TensorFlow
I use a Convolutional Neural Network - the popular VGG16 model, and visualize various filters from different layers of the CNN. I do this by using gradient ascent to visualize images that maximally activate specific filters from different layers of the model

(Detailed comments in the code)

`main.py`

Steps Involved:
1. Downloading the Model (VGG-16 model)
2. Get Submodels (layers)
3. Image Visualization (Matplotlib)
4. Training Loop (training for 100 epochs)
5. Final Results (Visualize different filter patterns)
