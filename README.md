# Visualizing-Filters-of-a-CNN-using-TensorFlow
I use a Convolutional Neural Network - the popular VGG16 model, and visualize various filters from different layers of the CNN. I do this by using gradient ascent to visualize images that maximally activate specific filters from different layers of the model
